## About This Project

This is a real-time, WebGL-based, 3D visualization of our Solar System. It's a complete re-write of the [original Tycho.io](https://github.com/jshor/tycho.io) project. Check out the full experience at **[tycho.io](https://tycho.io)**!

## Development

### Package Management

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

### Framework + Libraries

This app is built using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)/[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [THREE.js](https://threejs.org), and uses [react-three-renderer](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer) for THREE-based React components. It's bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Styling

Each DOM component contains a corresponding [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheet and employs the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) CSS design pattern. This app uses [node-sass-chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-chokidar) for Sass compilation.

### Testing

Tests use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), and [snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html#content) for components.

#### Testing Guidelines

* The importance of code coverage should not supercede the importance of writing good quality tests. 
* Methods for containers should contain a corresponding unit test, and is ideally written as a pure function.
* For exceptions, such as when a local state is updated, there should be a corresponding integration test.
* Components should be [snapshot tested](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html#content).
* [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).

## Application Architecture

The overall architecture uses the [React/Redux container pattern](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/the-react-plus-redux-container-pattern/). In a nutshell, containers in this app leverage tasks such as handling state and minor front-end logic, while components simply handle the presentation. Physics calculations and business logic is delegated to services, and some critical components, such as the Camera, have dedicated services.

### State management

All shared-state data is stored in the Redux store. This includes the 2D and 3D positions of objects and the current time. This enables unidirectional data flow (see [advantages of Redux](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3w8uey/what_are_the_real_benefits_of_using_fluxredux/)). In rare cases, some components will use the local state for things internal to that component, when appropriate.

## Static Data

The JSON data for `orbitals.json` is generated by the [yarn orbitals](#yarn-orbitals) script. It will look for all of the JSON files in the `public/static/data/orbitals` directory. For information on the file structure for these JSON files, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/jshor/tycho2/wiki/Orbital-JSONs).

## Folder Structure

This project utilizes a typical React app flat directory structure. Tests for each item typically live in `__tests__`. Components have corresponding tests and Sass in the same directory. `__tests__` folders may contain `__snapshots__` and `__fixtures__`.

Note that 3D React components and DOMElement ones coexist in the same general paths.

Static assets, such as textures, media, and data are stored in the `public` folder. The `img`, `js`, `css` and some JSON file contents are generated by build scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
It will also build the CSS using `build-css`.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `yarn test:coverage`

Runs all tests and prints out code covfefe.<br>

### `yarn lint`

Runs the linter using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).<br>

### `yarn lint:fix`

Fixes any linting errors discovered by the linter and reports any issues that could not be addressed automatically.<br>

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br>
It also runs the compilation script for the orbital data json.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `yarn deploy`

Performs a full deploy.<br>
Requires credentials defined at `~/.aws/credentials`. [More info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html).

#### `yarn deploy:upload`

Uploads the `build/` contents to the designated production AWS S3 bucket.<br>

#### `yarn deploy:invalidate`

[Invalidates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html) the designated AWS CloudFront instance.<br>

### `yarn orbitals`

Runs the compilation script for the orbital data json.

### `yarn ephemeris`

Takes all orbital JSONs, probes the [NASA/JPL HORIZONS database]() for ephemeris data, and updates each JSON accordingly. For more information on this script, and on the prerequisite data format, please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/jshor/tycho2/wiki/Orbital-JSONs#nasa-jpl-horizons).
